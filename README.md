# Project Description
Our project aims to develop a specialized Domain-Specific Language (DSL) that empowers users to take control of their smart home devices, primarily focusing on optimizing energy consumption. Through our DSL, users will have the flexibility to define personalized rules for automating their homes, tailoring them to their preferences and needs. One illustrative scenario could involve users setting a rule that triggers when their electricity costs surpass a specific threshold (a value they can input). In response, non-essential devices would automatically power down. Additionally, users could create rules to deactivate non-essential or high-energy-consuming devices during off-peak hours they define. Furthermore, our project envisions implementing location-based triggers, allowing users to activate certain devices, like heating systems, when they approach a specific distance from their home. The potential for home automation is vast, and this serves as our foundational concept.

# Project Relation
Regarding the connection to parsing, interpretation, and compilation, our project involves significant aspects of these key computational concepts. Parsing plays a crucial role in understanding and translating the user-defined rules written in our DSL into a structured format that the system can comprehend. Interpretation involves the process of executing these rules, making real-time decisions based on the interpreted instructions, and interacting with smart home devices accordingly. Lastly, compilation comes into play when we optimize and convert high-level user-defined rules into efficient, machine-readable code that ensures seamless automation. These aspects are pivotal in turning user intentions into actionable commands for smart home devices, making our project a compelling blend of software development and home automation expertise.
