# Group Members
Madi Tansy, Max Miller, Sanil Doshi

# Work Division 
- Submission 1: All members collaborated to come up with a project idea, and Madi took the ideas and put it together in a write up. 
- Submission 2: Madi created the public github repo and worked on the paragraph explaining the project in further detail. Madi created the design.md file and added some design block semantics. Sanil created the README with the critial appraisal and description of the project. 
- Submission 3: Madi updated the design2.md file with more detail about how the Blockly code will be executed. Sanil and Max gave input on what more to add, such as the recursive use case and Madi added it in. Madi also created the annotated-referenced.md file and added references, given by Max and Sanil.
- Submission 4: Sanil created the custom Blockly blocks, which was sent to Madi and Max to look over. Madi and Max added code to have the blocks generate JavaScript code. 
- Submission 5: Madi created the log.md file and explained how the work is divided between the group, along with adding functionality to Blockly to save the code. Sanil helped with errors and pushing to GitHub.

- Final Bit: Madi and Max worked on continuing to connect Blockly to openHAB, while Sanil worked on adding more block functionalities so that we would at least have some Blockly code to demonstrate for our final if the openHAB connectoin failed, which it did. Sanil and Madi worked on making the defualt blocks load into Blockly automatically when it opens, but despite having the defaultBlocks.js file and the script running in index.html, it still does not show up, and we are not sure why. Madi then made the videos and did everything else related to the final submission.

# AI Usage
- AI has been used to help fix errors with the Blockly code (ex. ChatGPT).
