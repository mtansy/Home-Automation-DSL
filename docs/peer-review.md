We received a lot of valuable feedback during the peer review, focusing on key aspects such as conflict resolution, user interface clarity, compatibility, troubleshooting, and user management. Katherineâ€™s suggestions highlighted the importance of addressing conflicts between rules, proposing a simulation mode for testing, providing examples for better understanding, explaining the workflow through diagrams, and ensuring visibility into system behavior. Catherine reinforced the concern about conflicts and suggested incorporating rules or guidelines for users, along with warning notifications. They also recommended a dropdown option for different smart appliances. Pelin focused on the UX/UI, suggesting clearer purposes for elements and questioning the need for different categories. Suparna acknowledged the project's cool concept and energy optimization but emphasized the need for robust conflict resolution, security measures for multiple users, and the potential for expanding Home Assistant for shared rules among household members.

To address these suggestions, we decided to work on implementing a priority system for rules, clearly communicating it to users and incorporating warning notifications when potential conflicts arise. We are also thinking about adding a simulation mode for users to test rules before deploying them, ensuring a safer and more user-friendly experience. To enhance user understanding, we are also going to work on including examples of standard home automation rules in the documentation. This will allow us to be able to give users a better understanding of how to start with this program, and how it can help them. A lot of the suggestions that we were given are more long-term goals, which we will be working on after this semester as well, as we believe that this project has a lot of potential. By the end of the semester however, we are wanting to fix the more minor suggestions that were given, such as adding more blocks and drop-down menus to use blocks for different smart home items. Along with this, we want to make sure that our openHAB instance will be available for others to use, which is our main priority as of right now. This is due to the fact that without having an instance for others to use, then they cannot automate their homes, so just adding more blocks will not have the same effect. We have made significant progress with setting up the openHAB instance, and are hoping to have it all ready to go within the next few weeks.
